* It’s all about communicating.

#### Example:
I will approach my manager and say the following: 

I am having trouble to wrapping my head around how to complete each steps of the project to for it to be down in that time frame.

Can we sit down and talk through to the all the tasks that I think need to be done in order for us to achieve it. Also would you mind if we go through the estimated time to achieve it, because may be I am missing some details or wrongly estimated the time needed for some tasks. Many be we can cut out some steps or maybe we are over thinking it here. Can we work through this together?

May be my manager or myself don’t have all the information, maybe I am misinterpreting the task. So before I started to have tons of assumptions and get emotional, I should sit down and ask for clarification.

It always come down to communication and the process of doing things. Maybe actually we have dealt with this question before. We can think back and then recount the similar scenarios that we were able to handle it and formulate the processes that we solve the problem.

Personality type:

Commander, energizer: go right in and say it can not be done.

empathizer, and contemplate: suck it up, stressing out, angry, but the boss has no idea that it can be done.

We should take the ownership of communication processes to get everybody on the same page.
